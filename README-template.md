# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl).

## Overview

I solved this challenge using Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

The constituent parts of the page are broken down into relevant components for modularity and reusability.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
